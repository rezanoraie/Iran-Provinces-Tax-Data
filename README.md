Hello,  
Here you could find Iran Provinces Tax Data and GDP  
from 1391-1394 (will be updated up to 1400)  
  
  
I only used official sources below to provide these data:  
https://taxresearch.ir/page.php?slct_pg_id=32&sid=1&slc_lang=fa  
https://salnameh.sci.org.ir/AllUser/DirectoryTreeComplete.aspx  
https://stat.roostanet.com/  
  
  
Everybody could use these data for free, offcourse with Copyrights and citation to this web page.  
Good luck
